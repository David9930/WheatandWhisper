## 🔍 How to Tell YAML is Valid

**In YAML, you know it's complete when:**
1. All sections have matching indentation
2. The last entry is fully defined
3. No lines are hanging without values

**Think of it like an outline:**
```
Collections:
  - Farm Updates:
      - Title field
      - Date field
      - Body field
  - Products:
      - Name field
      - Price field
  - Pages:
      - About Section
          - Title field
          - Story field
          - Photo field
← End of outline, no closing needed
